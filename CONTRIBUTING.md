## üìù How to add an article to the blog?

All articles are listed in the `src/content/posts/YYYY/MM/DD` folder structure where date is the date of publication.

Make sure to complete the _frontmatter_ part of your Markdown file in order to define at least those attributes:

```markdown
---
layout: ../../../../../layouts/post.astro
title: Title of your article
description: Description of your article visible in search page results
author: author_of_your_article 
tags: [example, of, tags]
---
```

The _frontmatter_ is configured through a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema in `src/content/config.ts`.

In order to add a new article, you should open a Pull Request on this repository.
A preview will automatically be deployed on AWS thanks to AWS Amplify service.

Don't hesitate to share your new post of **#proj-blog-tech-bedrock** slack room to ask for reviews from Bedrockers.
When you have 2 approves and no change requested, you can merge your Pull Request.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Add an author

Add a `<author_id>.json` file in `src/content/authors` folder. You can check the `src/content/authors/bedrock.json` file
as an example. You can add the avatar image in the same folder for it to be referenced like `./<images>.jpg` in the author json file.

Authors could have a `name`, a `url` and an `avatar` (which could be a distant file or an image hosted in the directory).

Then you will be able to use the author ID in the frontmatter post configuration key named `author`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è the site will keep you from building if you use an author ID that does not exist.

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è Add a LFT replay

Similar to adding an article, you can add a Last Friday Talk replay to the blog by adding a markdown file in the `src/content/lfts/YYYY/MM/DD` folder structure.
The most different parts are: 
- that you should use the `lft.astro` layout instead of the `post.astro` layout.
- you should add a `youtubeId` key in the frontmatter to embed the video in the page and get the thumbnail.

Here is an example of an LFT frontmatter
```markdown
---
layout: ../../../../../layouts/video.astro
title: "Le LFT du LFT - PUB LFT #LFT 02/02/24"
description: ""
author: team_lft
tags: [lft, tech]
color: rgb(251,87,66)
youtubeId: UgOFZmOJOmo
```

## üé§ Add a conference

Similar to adding an article, you can add a conference to the blog by adding a markdown file in the `src/content/conferences/YYYY/MM/DD` folder structure.
Here is an example of a conference frontmatter
```markdown
---
title: "Projet XState"
author: m_blanc
description: "La gestion d'√©tat applicative est une notion complexe et fondamentale (donc passionnante) des applications web modernes. Pour garder le contr√¥le de votre application, venez d√©couvrir XState, un moteur d'√©tats reposant sur le concept de machines √† √©tats finis."
