## How to install the project?

### Using Visual Studio Code

1. Install Docker or Podman on your machine
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the recommended [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
3. When VS code prompts you, agree to "Reopen in Container"
4. The blog should be built, refreshed and opened in a preview tab automagically. âœ¨
    - If not, you can run the "Jekyll Serve" VS Code task manually.

### With Ruby and Gem

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BedrockStreaming/tech.bedrockstreaming.com.git
cd tech.bedrockstreaming.com
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
```

Then run this command to run a dev server locally.
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

:warning: There are some issues to run this project on M1 archi for now.

### With docker

You can use docker to run the tech blog locally.

```shell
docker build -t tech-blog .
docker run -p 8080:8080 tech-blog 
```

## How to add an article to the blog?
 
All articles are listed in the `_posts` folder.
Each article is a Markdown file named like this `YYYY-MM-DD-article-slug.md` where date is the date of publication.
:information: If you put a future date of publication, your article won't be visible until this date is passed.

Make sure to complete the _frontmatter_ part of your Markdown file in order to define at least those attributes:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Title of your article
description: Description of your article visible in search page results
author: author_of_your_article 
tags: [example, of, tags]
color: rgb(251,87,66) # this is Bedrock color here
---
```

We are using a community theme for Jekyll for this blog, you may find some usefull examples here:

  You can store your images in _images/post_ folder of this repository.  
  Don't forget to compress them for performances with tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)

- [How to add simple Diagrams with _Mermaids_?](https://sylhare.github.io/Type-on-Strap/2019/11/02/Tech-stuff-example.html#mermaid)
  Mermaid is a really powerful tool to generate Diagram dynamically with some text.
  Check [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
- How to add an author ? 
  Edit `_data/authors.yml` file to add an author directly in the Yaml file.
  Author could have a name, an URL and an avatar (which could be a distant file or an image hosted in _images/author_ directory).
  Then use the author id in the post frontmatter configuration key named `author`.

In order to add a new article, you should open a Pull Request on this repository.
A preview will automatically be deployed on AWS thanks to AWS Amplify service.

Don't hesitate to share your new post of **#proj-blog-tech-bedrock** slack room to ask for reviews from Bedrockers.
When you have 2 approves and no change requested, you can merge your Pull Request.

## Add a conference

There are two ways to publish a conference where you were a speaker.
Please note that creating a post is more likely to help our external communication.

### Publish informations about the conference

If you just want to add a conference presentation to the listed ones, you can add your presentation in `_data/conferences.yaml`.

Here is metadatas allowed to add a new conference :

```markdown

  # Conference date
  date: 1970-01-01
  # from _data/authors.yaml
  author: conference_speaker 
  # Public event name
  eventName: ******
  # Url to redirect to event site (optionnal)
  eventUrl: ******
  # Youtube video id (optionnal)
  youtubeId: ******
  # Slideshare presentation key (from iframe integration) (optionnal)
  slideshareKey: ******
```

It's all folks ! Your conference will be displayed in "Meetups & Conferences" page, and if there is a `youtubeId` key, the video will be added to "Replay" section.


### Create a post to present the conference
