Some time ago, we shared with you [an article explaining how we managed to capture and broadcast our conferences in the Bedrock auditorium](/2021/10/14/live-streaming-lft.html). 
We must admit, it worked great, but we wanted to make it simpler.

As a reminder, our internal conferences or meetups are called **LFT**. 
If you want to know more about our _Last Friday Talk_ and the motivations that push us to do it, we invite you to read the above-mentioned article.

Strong of the success of this broadcasting, the voluntary team of organization wished for the next one to succeed in making as well in simpler. 
_It was already a challenge in itself!_
If you read [this part of the article](/2021/10/14/live-streaming-lft.html#Some%20things%20to%20improve), you can see that we already had some ideas for improvements.

## Improvement areas

In the previous version, you could see that a very important quantity of material was necessary (meters of various cables, multi plugs, a camera, a computer under windows, etc...)
A large part of this material was kindly lent by Pascal Martin (and we thank him for that), but we could not decently borrow it for each LFT.

Moreover, this very specific equipment did not allow **each Bedrock employee to be able to take over the role of the control room** at a glance with his own machine.
Finally, as you can imagine, setting up and putting away such a large amount of equipment **takes a lot of time**. 
_There were no less than four of us setting up and tidying up._

In another topic, let's talk about video quality. We used to use _Google Live Stream_ before, but the 720p broadcast, with its very low bitrate and aggressive compression, sometimes made it difficult to follow.
_Text and images were often very pixelated._

We finally wanted to be able to more easily handle a _hybrid_ mode to our LFTs. $
Because of the pandemic, telecommuting and the fact that some of Bedrock's employees are located in Paris, we need to be able to broadcast and capture the LFT both in person and remotely.
By _hybrid_ mode we also meant that during the same event, we wanted to be able to host speakers from the location of their choice.

## What we did 

After a few exchanges with other conference organizations, we decided to give [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) a chance.
With some quick tests, we took a license and started the new version of the LFT.
