The Frontend Bedrock team was present at the 2023 edition of the _We Love Speed_ conference in Paris on May 10. Its aim is to share as widely as possible knowledge and experience in the field of web performance.

Webperf, or web performance, refers to the set of techniques and best practices aimed at optimizing the loading speed and user experience of websites. It covers various aspects such as page loading time, interface responsiveness, animation fluidity, server request processing capacity, etc.

Webbperf is a major challenge in today's web industry, influencing user experience, website visibility and overall commercial success. This article summarizes the topics discussed at this year's _We Love Speed_ conference and gives an overview of the 2023 approach to web performance.

## Why optimize your sites' webperf?

### It's all about money ü§ë

Improving the webperf just for the technical challenge is not interesting in a company perspective and can't make the approach durable. [Boris Schapira in his talk _"Parlons de valeur"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0zCqZRuSs) üá´üá∑ shows how important it is to talk about **value** to make optimisation projects part of an organisation strategy.

Web performance is essential, as it has a direct impact on user satisfaction, engagement and the overall success of a website. Fast performance enables users to access information quickly, interact without delay and navigate smoothly. On the other hand, slow loading times, frozen interfaces or high response times can lead to user frustration, lower engagement and higher bounce rates.

A lot of articles on the net have proved **the impact of the webperf on users' engagement**. So, depending on the site's field, it's relatively easy to link the webperf approach to an objective of user views or loyalty, but also with the brand image. And the company's governance will be able to quickly measure the benefits in terms of return on investment.

### What about SEO?

Moreover, search engines such as Google also place give a relative importance on website performance in their ranking algorithms. Faster, more optimized sites often benefit from better positioning in search results, which can have a significant impact on their visibility and traffic.

However, [Philippe Yonnet's talk _"Quel est le v√©ritable impact des probl√®mes de web performance sur le SEO‚ÄØ?"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWqQCOX52i4) üá´üá∑ reveals that actually the Google webperf scoring is in reality quite low in all the parameters taken into account in the ranking algorithm. Relevant content is always the first factor in top positioning. As was the case with responsive design a few years ago, the Google's communication around webperf is aimed more at **encouraging good practices** in the web community than at really penalizing slow sites.

## How do you take up a performance project?

### Build a long-term strategy based on usages

You need a strategy and a speech! [Boris Schapira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0zCqZRuSs) üá´üá∑ defines 6 steps:

1. Identify the sticking point
2. Associate a value to the project for the business
3. Invest time for the optimizations
4. Evaluate the ROI
5. Sustaine the approach over time (it should never be a one shot project)

We now use universally the [Google's Core Web Vitals KPI](https://web.dev/vitals/) to model the user experience:

- Does users have a stable visual response? ‚û°Ô∏è it's measured though the _Cumulative Layout Shift_ (CLS)
- Do users quickly see content they can trust? ‚û°Ô∏è it's measured though the _Largest Contentful Paint_ (LCP)
- Can users quickly interact with the page in a qualitative way? ‚û°Ô∏è it's measured though the _First Input Delay_ (FID)

But these KPI are a limited reflection of user experience, and it is hard to link as it to a representative value. **You need to correlate these measures with usages**. There is no magic solution for this but segmenting sessions is a good practice to focus on relevant optimizations:

- take a period of time where the measure is representative (e.g. on our streaming sites, the activity period is mainly in the evening)
- take into account the fact that different actions or events on your site may not involve the same users (so not the same devices, etc.)
- take "short" indicators to measure the impact of the performance (e.g. if users are on a product list, monitor the viewing of the product page and not the purchase of the product)
- take into account the market you're addressing (food click & collect users are more likely to wait the loading of the next page than users on a retail site)
