The Frontend Bedrock team was present at the 2023 edition of the _We Love Speed_ conference in Paris on May 10. Its aim is to share as widely as possible knowledge and experience in the field of web performance.

Webperf, or web performance, refers to the set of techniques and best practices aimed at optimizing the loading speed and user experience of websites. It covers various aspects such as page loading time, interface responsiveness, animation fluidity, server request processing capacity, etc.

Webbperf is a major challenge in today's web industry, influencing user experience, website visibility and overall commercial success. This article summarizes the topics discussed at this year's _We Love Speed_ conference and gives an overview of the 2023 approach to web performance.

## Why optimize your sites' webperf?

### It's all about money ðŸ¤‘

Improving the webperf just for the technical challenge is not interesting in a company perspective and can't make the approach durable. [Boris Schapira in his talk _"Parlons de valeur"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0zCqZRuSs) shows how important it is to talk about **value** to make optimisation projects part of an organisation strategy.

Web performance is essential, as it has a direct impact on user satisfaction, engagement and the overall success of a website. Fast performance enables users to access information quickly, interact without delay and navigate smoothly. On the other hand, slow loading times, frozen interfaces or high response times can lead to user frustration, lower engagement and higher bounce rates.

A lot of articles on the net have proved **the impact of the webperf on users' engagement**. So, depending on the site's field, it's relatively easy to link the webperf approach to an objective of user views or loyalty. And the company's governance will be able to quickly measure the benefits in terms of return on investment.

### What about SEO?

Moreover, search engines such as Google also place give a relative importance on website performance in their ranking algorithms. Faster, more optimized sites often benefit from better positioning in search results, which can have a significant impact on their visibility and traffic.

However, [Philippe Yonnet's talk _"Quel est le vÃ©ritable impact des problÃ¨mes de web performance sur le SEOâ€¯?"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWqQCOX52i4) reveals that actually the Google webperf scoring is in reality quite low in all the parameters taken into account in the ranking algorithm. Relevant content is always the first factor in top positioning. As was the case with responsive design a few years ago, the Google's communication around webperf is aimed more at **encouraging good practices** in the web community than at really penalizing slow sites.
