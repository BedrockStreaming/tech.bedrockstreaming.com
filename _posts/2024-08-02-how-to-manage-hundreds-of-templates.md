## The context

Today, at **Bedrock** company, we are providing a streaming service on:
- 11 common **CTV** platforms: Tizen, Philips, WebOS, Hisense, Panasonic, Orange, Xbox, PS4, Orsay, Smart Alliance, WhaleOS
- 6 **Android** platforms: mobile, AndroidTV, bytel, free, SFR, FireTV
- 2 **Apple** platforms: iOS / tvOS
- 1 **Web** platform
- a lot of specific devices

Each of these platforms has its own guidelines and usage (interaction, screen sizes, etc) and is managed by a dedicated team in our organization. They also have their own native **design components** on which our implementations rely to offer the best possible experience.  

Bedrock currently has three clients (M6+, RTL+ Hungary, Videoland), each of them has their dedicated application on each platform. But they also have their own design expectations and branding guidelines.  
At their disposal, they have a **design system**: a set of visual assets they can use to render pages. These components follow the atomic design model, which means that each layer is a composition of the previous one. Here is a non-exhaustive list: 
- 14 **tokens**: base element that defines the brand (ex: Colors, FontSystem, Radius, Shadow, Breakpoints, Treatments...)
- 9 **atoms**: simplest design item that cannot be decomposed (ex: Icons, Avatar, CheckBox, ProgressBar, ServiceIcon, Separator...)
- 62 **molecules**: group of atoms that forms a visual unity (ex: Card, Poster, HorizontalCard, Button, CTA, Portrait, Totem...)
- 12 **organisms**: complex visual item or part of the interface (ex: Jumbotron, Hero, Solo, Banner...)

This results in, approximately, one hundred design elements per client. However, not all components are always specific, and an **inheritance** system is in place to allow clients to reuse default atoms, molecules, or organisms while applying the tokens corresponding to their brand.  

The objectives and expectations vary greatly among clients, resulting in **numerous graphical element evolutions**. Managing the creation and progression of these elements through different processes is a major challenge in tracking designs across each platform. These demands sometimes lead to **different integrations**. Whether or not the default design is inherited is crucial information to avoid manually comparing the app designs with documentation, which can lead to misunderstandings and wasted time during validation and approval processes.

## One versioning to rule them all 

Therefore, implementing a versioning system became essential to continue enriching and evolving our clientâ€™s design systems.  
To ensure its interest and effectiveness, this system had to address several issues:
- **Be specific** to each platform and each client: evolution progress does not occur at the same pace across all platforms. This also allows for comparing design progress between platforms.  
- Allow **visualizing the inheritance** between the default design system and the client's specific part on the same platform. We also wanted the ability to add comments on implementation details.  
- Be **directly accessible** with each build to stay in touch with the application it represents. On mobile, many builds are generated daily, making it difficult to track the arrival of new features.  
- Stay **up-to-date** with the constant evolutions of the design system to maintain the source of truth.

![Release note of the Design system](/images/posts/2024-08-02-how-to-manage-hundreds-of-templates/design-release-note.png)  
 
Initially, the design team began by versioning its releases and all available components, which are accessible to technical teams in our online design documentation (hosted on [ZeroHeight](https://zeroheight.com/)). This versioning is **common to all platforms** and all clients if there are no specificities for the component in question. Ultimately, versioning helps product and technical teams track the delivery progress of new designs. The version number follows these rules:

Code status | Stage | Rule | Example  
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:  
First release | New collection | 1.0.0 | 1.0.0  
Documentation update without impact on the anatomy of design element | Documentation update | Increment the third digit | 1.0.1  
New backward-compatible feature | Minor release | Increment the 2nd digit and reset the third | 1.1.0  
Change on element that breaks backward compatibility | Major release | Increment the first digit and reset the second and the third | 2.0.0  

Each frontend team was then responsible for implementing an equivalent versioning system representing the state of their platform. This was done through a **feature team** including all frontends, design system managers, and the product team. This organization brought numerous benefits:
- Facilitating the **synchronization** and homogeneity of product templates
- **Sharing** development challenges
- **Limiting** versioning differences between frontends
- Sharing **industrialization** ideas

## A concrete sample: Android

On Android side, we sometimes have different component implementations between mobile and TV, evolving at different paces. This required **two separate versionings** to represent them. Moreover, we currently use comments to track the migration to Google's new view system (Compose), which is happening alongside graphical evolutions.  
Each client has their **versioning file** containing all the components available on the targeted platform. Regarding component inheritance from the default design system, there are two possibilities:
- The component is **inherited** and thus has no specificities and no version in the client's versioning file, using the generic Bedrock customer version
- It has its **own implementation** and its associated version

Default Versioning file | Customer Versioning file  
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

From these **versioning files**, we have been able to generate **reports** for each platform containing only the available graphical elements and their version, whether inherited or not. To track their growing number, we opted for automatic generation of these reports with each build in our continuous integration system using a KGP (Kotlin Gradle Plugin) script integrated on our continuous deployment and integration (CI/CD): [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io/).

## Conclusion

This system generally addresses our issue, and these reports allow a **quick and exhaustive overview** of the design system at any given moment for any of our customers.
However, improvements are always possible:
- Currently, developers are responsible for **updating the versioning file** when adding or modifying graphical elements, which can lead to errors and omissions. To avoid this, we would like to link the concrete implementation of the component and its version in the versioning file. But as we are still using the android legacy view system, component can be class but also xml style or theme or even resource files. This should be easier after the migration to the new Android view system Compose.
- The reports are currently generated in **XML format**, which does not facilitate their use; using the PDF format would be preferable.
- **Access through Bitrise** is not ideal. We currently centralize all generated builds (using CI as well) in [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/). A link would be preferable and more visible.  

Versioning allows us to know the state of all components on a platform at a given time and simplifies the QA teams validation work. It is an essential tool for tracking design progress across all supported platforms.
