Within less than a year m6web and [techm6web](https://twitter.com/Bedrock_Stream) managed to launch websites, android apps and ios apps for three RTL TV channels in Europe, all based on the [6play](https://www.6play.fr) technology. 

These deployments include: 

* broadcasted and themathic channels,
* live streaming, video catchup encoding and playout,
* video resuming,
* local adservers (for videos and display), DMP system and CDN,
* contribution via our backoffice and automated through our API,
* translations system,
* and almost all the features of the 6play platform.
