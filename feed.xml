It’s based on 5 tracks a day, covering resilience, scalability, architecture, monitoring, performance, management and all the subjects that speak to tech companies. None of these tracks are sponsored: they’re all about feedback, with no marketing whatsoever. There is a 6th track where sponsorship is permitted, and it’s the only one. There aren’t many sponsorship stands, and you go to this conference to talk to your peers first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to focus on feedback from teams facing similar problems to those we face at Bedrock Streaming. It was an inspiring conference, which reinforced some of our choices and gave us ideas for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will summarise what we have learned from each theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all optimisations are necessarily relevant, and it is important to measure their benefits and compare their costs. Some make the code more complex, while others lead to weaknesses in resilience. It’s all about compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the main case, rather than anticipating all the possible exceptions, which can complicate the use in very isolated cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profiling is the key to your journey to optimization. However with one tool you are sure where problems lie but with a second one (or more) doubt creeps in… It is interesting to associate benchmarks before and after each optimization. And beware as the famous Pareto Principle,-aka the 80-20 rule-, as it turns out easy fixes are often the most efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t perform profiling? No problem just follow metrics and identify when a code change impacts your performances. What again? I can’t hear you with all this noisy data! Oh yes you are right, noise in your data is indeed a pain in the backend but you have to deal with it as it is commonplace. I know, this is scary, because you don’t come from a data engineering world but not worries, statistics are not so hard to tame. Go take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_detection&quot;&gt;Change Point Detection&lt;/a&gt;, a non-parametric test which helps you test if these changes you saw in your metrics are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now deep-dive in a more opaque layer of our system composed by the kernel. Here we have to admit that the heuristics at stake while for example choosing on which CPUs or GPUs to execute are not easily tweakables, despite the fact that it was shown they indeed impact overall performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the promising solutions is the famous tool cilium/eBPF which allows you to directly reprogram certain behaviours of your kernel, especially the network (for the cilium part), without having to recompile the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some think that regarding these kernel issues we are stuck in a local maximum and it will require a mindset shift to fully overcome these hardware performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scaling&quot;&gt;Scaling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around scaling, we attended both technical and organisational talks.
On the technical side, there are a number of relevant ideas. Always contain your costs - especially in the Cloud, with all its hidden expenses. Aiming for the highest possible SLO is a higher priority than cutting costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some incidents are an accumulation of many changes and are not linked to one team/one change/one regression. Those problems lead to long investigations and cannot be resolved by a simple rollback. This counterpart comes naturally with innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architects or equivalent must always coordinate internal exchanges: timeout durations, number and relevance of retries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, standardising tools brings more benefits than choosing a highly optimised tool that is different for each team. Try to reuse code and don’t reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several presenters spoke of asynchronous and ‘real-time’ scalability (meaning millions of users in a matter of seconds). The bottom line for all of them is that there is no way of scaling the necessary resources so quickly: everyone pre-scales. The pre-scaling itself can take a long time, so for a particular event (such as a sports match), resources need to be launched several hours in advance. Asynchronous processing can help to spread out all the non-critical calculations over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to be patient! It really seems to go against the tide, yet designing long-time running APIs (meaning APIs that can handle waiting) really seems to be the key of success when trying to address scalability issues. Likewise try as much as possible not to overlap your APIs field of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the organisational level, architects of all kinds must identify or create links between all elements in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architect’s vision is to understand the choices and make compromises between the teams so that the whole is coherent. There is no lock-in. Every choice brings both positives and negatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainability&quot;&gt;Sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including sustainability in our business processes is a recent but no less important necessity. And do you know what? As it turns out, it often means cutting costs, increasing performances and resiliency!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2024-04-17-qcon-london-2024/2024-04-10-what-makes-software-green.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What makes software green?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can sum up is that we have the power to act at our own level. Choose services that auto-scale, prefer ARM instances, select partners who measure and try to improve their Carbon emissions. In many cases, Serverless or Compute@Edge can be a very good choice for applications that can take huge load spikes as much as a few requests (quickly scalable and extremely elastic). When possible, try to run jobs during the night, when load spikes are over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to use energy when it is really needed: switching off dev and staging environments when employees are resting. Limit over-provisioning of resources and pre-scaling times.
All cloud providers include a sustainability section in their ‘well-architected’ programs, a section that is independent of performance and costs, even though it provides co-benefits with those two subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is in companies’ interests to move in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;management-people-and--process&quot;&gt;Management, People and  Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe first keep in mind that decisions are not right or bad, they just are taken by a person or a quorum based on the context they had on a given time. And let’s face it, your organisation will need to change over time especially if you begin as a start-up and now need to scale-up (oh an interesting topic of scaling coming back!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for scaling your infrastructure, you need to realise that you will need to make compromises. For example, Trainline shared with us that their three pillars are: Alignment, Productivity and Code Quality. You can’t perform in the three at the same time, you need to choose which one(s) to let go a little in order to achieve the company’s goal. Importantly what is working at a given time in a certain situation could not be appropriate anymore months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;platform-engineering&quot;&gt;Platform Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the conference offered a dedicated track on platform engineering, where we listened to the insights shared by the speakers. As they delved into their own experiences and learnings, we found striking parallels with our own journey at Bedrock over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2024-04-17-qcon-london-2024/2024-04-09-Trainline-lessons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lessons from Trainline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most resonant themes was the importance of treating the platform as a product: a perspective shift that has significantly influenced our approach. By emphasising the need for a smoother experience that balances consistency, performance, security, and development speed, the speakers reinforced the notion that our platform isn’t just a set of tools; it’s a crucial enabler for our developers’ success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of providing a golden path for developers stood out as particularly impactful. We’ve come to realise that by streamlining the onboarding process and offering clear guidelines, we can empower developers to navigate the platform with confidence and efficiency. This approach not only accelerates time-to-market for new features but also fosters a sense of trust between the platform team and its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key takeaway was the importance of communication and trust-building within the organisation. We were reminded that trust is the currency of collaboration, and effective communication is essential for maintaining it. Clear documentation, transparent processes, and accessible points of contact were highlighted as critical components of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys emerged as a valuable tool for gathering feedback and gauging user satisfaction, although the speakers acknowledged the challenges in ensuring high engagement and confidence in the results. However, they emphasised that even imperfect data can provide valuable insights when interpreted thoughtfully and supplemented with other forms of feedback, such as user interviews and proactive communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers also shared their experiences with empowering developers to take ownership of certain tasks, such as fixing issues surfaced by conformity checks and contributing features that solved their own challenges back up to the general platform to benefit the whole organisation. This aligns closely with our own DevOps principles, emphasising collaboration and shared responsibility across teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the insights shared by the conference speakers, we’re reminded of the importance of continuous improvement and iteration in our platform engineering efforts. By learning from our mistakes, embracing new perspectives, and staying attuned to the needs of our users, we can continue to evolve our platform into a truly indispensable resource for our development community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our first QCon for most of us. We appreciated the transparency of the speakers and the commitment of the organisers, who made the event a success on every level: the intensity of the conferences, the quality of the talks, the really good and varied food and the discreet presence of the sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being very technical, this conference is a source of inspiration for us, as it focuses on feedback and encourages discussion with our peers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>[&quot;c_petit&quot;, &quot;j_foray&quot;, &quot;v_gallissot&quot;]</name></author><category term="cloud" /><category term="devops" /><category term="conference" /><category term="2024" /><summary type="html">We really enjoyed this QCon conference in London.

For a few, it was their first KubeCon! For one, it was the fourth one. Since Copenhagen in 2018, which was before we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/tci/&quot;&gt;moving to AWS and Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, so much has changed – and so much has not ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-ideas&quot;&gt;Big ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, these four days clearly highlighted some wide topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-and-gpus-everywhere&quot;&gt;AI and GPUs everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like “AI” was the impossible-to-miss subject vendors were trying to push, this year! Still, while many are running experiments, not many have deployed and maintained workloads in production yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many, we have started using a few “AI” tools and are working on some ideas &lt;em&gt;(not hosting them ourselves yet, though)&lt;/em&gt;, but we can’t help but feel “AI” and especially the “Generative AI” term is a bit over-used and some solutions we’ve seen were closer to good-old-ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are not planning on running our GenAI workloads on Kubernetes anytime soon, we haven’t been to many talks on this matter. Still, between re:Invent last year and KubeCon this year, you’ll find plenty of contents if that’s your thing 💪.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platform-engineering-is-the-new-devops&quot;&gt;Platform engineering is the new DevOps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, looks like &lt;em&gt;DevOps is dead&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Platform Engineering is the new DevOps&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, we clearly see having everything related to all your projects in one place brings tremendous value &lt;em&gt;(and we have a couple dashboards that go this way)&lt;/em&gt;. Same with providing a common basis &lt;em&gt;(Terraform, Golang Skeleton, Helm chart)&lt;/em&gt; most projects build upon instead of re-inventing it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we don’t think, today, &lt;em&gt;“being able to create a new service in one click and 15 seconds”&lt;/em&gt; is a goal we should aim for. We’d rather rationalize micro-services and reduce network overhead. Remember, distributed systems are &lt;em&gt;“easy”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Backstage has gained in traction over the past two years, and it would be the first tool we’d try if &lt;em&gt;(or when)&lt;/em&gt; we’d wanted to invest on this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;green-computing&quot;&gt;Green Computing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5NES1Is7rw&quot;&gt;Heating Pools with Cloud Power: A New Wave in Green Computing - Saiyam Pathak, Civo &amp;amp; Mark Bjornsgaard, Deep Green Technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, data centers’ electricity consumption uses 2% of the world’s electricity and the demand is growing exponentially due to more and more data centers being built. A very large percentage of future consumption will be dedicated to AI through high consumption GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Deep Green is embracing a generational shift as a company building a new kind of data centers. They aim to build small edge data centers as close as possible to heat consumers in order to recapture and distribute the heat. Indeed, in classic data centers, a huge chunk of energy is wasted into heat not being used. Chance with datacenter is that a very large amount of heat is produced in the same place (in comparison with other kind of industry). Deep Green’s computers are immersed into biodegradable oil which captures generated heat. Then, heat is transferred through heat exchangers to targets which can be swimming pools, private houses, offices… The process is simple and known for decades, but the smart move is to associate small edge data centers to heat consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2024-04-09-kubecon-europe-2024/deep-green.png&quot; alt=&quot;How deep green heats a pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about CNCF and kubernetes? CNCF tools are allowing them to make this work as efficient as possible by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;monitoring heat consumption and carbon emissions with tools like Kepler&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adapting workloads sizes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;managing intelligent workload scheduling: scheduling the workload to the datacenter which is actually requiring to heat up a particular consumer (using ArgoCD deployment, for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scaling-depending-on-energy-usage-of-instances&quot;&gt;Scaling depending on energy usage of instances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, sustainable IT has become a major issue for companies. At Bedrock streaming, we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our platforms. One of the first steps in this transition is to understand the impact of our applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At kubeCon 2024, we were able to discover a number of interesting tools that we’ll be testing in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kepler&quot;&gt;Kepler&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_a9mCTcxkk&quot;&gt;Sustainable Computing: Measuring Application Energy Consumption in Kubernetes Environments with Kepler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainable-computing.io/&quot;&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt; is a CNCF Sandbox project that uses eBPF to collect performance counters and other system statistics. Kepler estimates energy consumption per pod based on this data and exports it as Prometheus metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2024-04-09-kubecon-europe-2024/kepler.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Kepler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;peaks&quot;&gt;PEAKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPrSnZ4lyjw&quot;&gt;Empowering Efficiency: PEAKS - Orchestrating Power-Aware Kubernetes Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peaks aims to optimize the energy consumption of a kubernetes cluster during scheduling. Peaks relies on pre-trained ML models vs energy consumption to predict the most suitable nodes. The tool is not yet available, but development is progressing and a &lt;em&gt;Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal&lt;/em&gt; will be opened in the sig-scheduling project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tools represent significant advances towards more sustainable computing, and reflect the Kubernetes community’s commitment to responsible innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finops&quot;&gt;Finops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing – or optimizing – infrastructure costs has been a recurring topic at KubeCon for as long as we remember. Every year, there are talks about basic tools like HPA or ideas like using Spot instances &lt;em&gt;(like we do, for 100% our worker nodes!)&lt;/em&gt;. This time, Karpenter has clearly become a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics being covered, costs are still too high, and reducing them is getting even more complex than before as more stuff is deployed to Kubernetes. Thinks GPU-based or long-running workloads, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are beginning to see more and more approaches using &lt;strong&gt;machine learning to forecast how much resources will be needed at a given time&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on past data. We, like others, have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/03/prescaling.html&quot;&gt;our own pre-scaling mechanism&lt;/a&gt; – not based on ML yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kubernetes-and-developer-experience&quot;&gt;Kubernetes and Developer experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps and Ops, who manipulate Kubernetes and its objects everyday, we tend to forget: Kubernetes is not &lt;em&gt;(perceived as)&lt;/em&gt; easy for our developers colleagues, who only write manifests every once in a while or use kubectl when their app fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During “Developers Demand UX for K8s”, Mairin Duffy and Conor Cowman presented the results of an UX research they did amongst Kubernetes users and identified the main issues developers encounter with it. Debugging network issues, YAML &lt;em&gt;(indentation, lack of validation, clean export)&lt;/em&gt;, the infamous Crash Loop &lt;em&gt;(and disappering logs)&lt;/em&gt;, CLI vs GUI… Yeah, we’ve had all of those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have partially solved some of these issues, both with technical solutions &lt;em&gt;(Helm + Helmfile, reusable Github Action workflows)&lt;/em&gt; and training sessions, but debugging is still a pain :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-we-are-currently-working-on&quot;&gt;Things we are currently working on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keda&quot;&gt;Keda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_njiPr5vg&quot;&gt;Scaling New Heights with KEDA: Performance, Extensions, and Beyond - Jorge Turrado, SCRM Lidl International Hub &amp;amp; Zbynek Roubalik, Kedify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our ongoing quest to improve the efficiency of our Kubernetes clusters, we recently opted for Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA), a project supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and enjoying growing adoption by the community. This choice is in line with our desire to go further than the capabilities offered by our previous tool, the Prometheus adapter, thanks in particular to more refined scaling management based on various external metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of KEDA’s real strengths is its ability to adjust scaling via &lt;em&gt;‘scaling modifiers’&lt;/em&gt;, allowing precise adjustment of the number of pods as required based on a calculation. At Bedrock Streaming this will enable us to refine our prescaling strategy, previously &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/01/kubernetes-prescaling-we-open-source-our-solution.html&quot;&gt;based on an external metric provided by a go service&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll be able to upgrade our system to something simpler and more precise. Maybe evolve from a simple calculation of minimum pods and multipliers, to a more sophisticated approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation by Zbynek Roubalik and Jorge Turrado, KEDA maintainers, highlighted KEDA’s effectiveness in meeting various load requirements through the use of a variety of external metrics, making scaling more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cilium&quot;&gt;Cilium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilium (and eBPF) were well represented at KubeCon, with a number of conferences on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came at just the right time, as we are currently in the process of migrating to this CNI. This one, based on eBPF (with all that that implies) seemed to us to be a good replacement for our current CNI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With cilium: no more KubeProxy, and no more IPtables, which for large clusters is a major performance factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilium also enables network traffic to be filtered with NetworkPolicies inbound and outbound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature we particularly like is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://cilium.io/use-cases/cluster-mesh/&quot;&gt;cluster-mesh&lt;/a&gt;”, which allows you to communicate between several clusters in a fairly simple way, at least on paper 😊! (conference available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbB3TEiOb24&quot;&gt;⏩ here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also able to see new features such as GatewayAPI support from version 1.15, and the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cilium/statedb&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stateDB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from version 1.16 to manage the state of cilium objects (and therefore reconciliation in the event of inconsistent state (conference available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX0sql_3dt8&amp;amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PHDqy_nINY8-462uYzb18d&amp;amp;index=2&quot;&gt;⏩ here&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-and-idea-we-want-to-try-&quot;&gt;Tools and idea we want to try 💪&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KubeCon is also a great way to discover or re-discover new technologies or tools. We won’t share an exhaustive list &lt;em&gt;(see you there next year!)&lt;/em&gt;, but here are a few we are excited about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WebAssembly &lt;em&gt;(especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spinkube.dev/&quot;&gt;SpinKube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;: we are running some workloads at-edge on WASM and see a huge potential there. WASM in Kubernetes is intriguing, maybe as a way to reduce pods startup time?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openfeature.dev/&quot;&gt;OpenFeature&lt;/a&gt;: for feature-flipping, A/B testing… Glad to see the emergence of an open standard!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with multiple Kubernetes clusters: not something we think we need for now, but after hearing about Federation years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://karmada.io/&quot;&gt;Karmada&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the current tool for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;​​https://mirrord.dev/&quot;&gt;mirrord&lt;/a&gt;: to develop locally as-if inside a Kubernetes cluster, forwarding network and file accesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crik--criu-creating-snapshots-for-interrupted-pods&quot;&gt;Crik &amp;amp; Criu: creating snapshots for interrupted pods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2MbSM9-7Xs&quot;&gt;The Party Must Go on - Resume Pods After Spot Instance Shut Down - Muvaffak Onuş, QA Wolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the conference held by Muaffak Onuş of the CNCF, an innovative solution was highlighted to mitigate the instability of spot instances: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/qawolf/crik&quot;&gt;CRIK&lt;/a&gt; project, which leverages &lt;a href=&quot;https://criu.org/Main_Page&quot;&gt;CRIU&lt;/a&gt; to provide backup and restore functionality for Kubernetes pods. By leveraging CRIU, CRIK can capture the state of processes within a pod before a spot instance shutdown, and then restore them, making it easier to resume work after a spot reclaim for exemple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kubernetes controller is deployed, which monitors the state of nodes. When a pod with the required criu configuration is going to be deleted it consults the controller to check if the node is going to be deleted to dump all it’s processes, file descriptors etc… Before being restored on another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology is particularly relevant for Bedrock Streaming, where our entire Kubernetes clusters are based on EC2 spot instances. The use of CRIK could transform the way we manage extended jobs, particularly for our machine learning / AI teams, by ensuring the continuity of jobs lasting several hours despite instance interruptions. The integration of CRIK promises to substantially improve the resilience and efficiency of our cloud operations. We plan to test Crik at one of our future r&amp;amp;d days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cilium-as-cluster-mesh&quot;&gt;Cilium as cluster-mesh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbB3TEiOb24&quot;&gt;Simplifying Multi-Cluster and Multi-Cloud Deployments with Cilium - Liz Rice, Isovalent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that caught our attention was the native Cluster-Mesh feature which could allow us to connect multiple clusters between them with little effort and potentially multiple cloud providers between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To allow each Cilium’s components to communicate between them an internal load-balancer is deployed in each cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some prerequisites to allow cluster mesh though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CIDR block must not overlapped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each cluster needs to have their own unique ID and name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All clusters need to use Cilium as their CNI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cluster Mesh option has to be enabled on each cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Rice did a live presentation of cluster mesh capabilities with some use cases and functionalities like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creation of global services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to setup affinity rules for local cluster and remote one, to prefer the usage of local cluster pods and fallback to remote if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup of network policies to cluster level with the Cilium’s ability to add custom labels to pods to identify the cluster they’re running on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if for now the usage of multi-cluster through different cloud providers is not a common use case the fact that Isovalent succeeded to make it that simple is very impressive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilium is now the new standard and we are glad to have chosen it on our clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;openfga&quot;&gt;OpenFGA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaK1EnRgrng&quot;&gt;Federated IAM for Kubernetes with OpenFGA - Jonathan Whitaker, Okta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the presentations that stood out for us, the one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://openfga.dev/&quot;&gt;OpenFGA&lt;/a&gt; really grabbed our attention. OpenFGA, or Fine Grained Authorization, is an open source project that promises to transform the way we manage authorization and identity federation in modern applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenFGA is a universal authorization solution that enables complex authorizations to be modeled in a granular way. Inspired by Google’s Zanzibar project, OpenFGA offers a developer-friendly API, while guaranteeing performance and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenFGA gives us the ability to define detailed access policies, which is crucial for identity and access management in dynamic environments like Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenFGA tool represents a major advance in the field of IT security. Its flexibility, performance and open approach make it an ideal candidate for companies looking to implement robust identity federation. The presentation at KubeCon 2024 only confirmed the immense potential of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-are-no-longer-problems&quot;&gt;Things that are no longer “problems”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic reactive auto-scaling. Still challenges: using &amp;gt;50% of resources, predictive pre-scaling, long-running tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic Kubernetes observability. Still challenges: observability at large-scale and/or for large distributed systems that go beyond Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using EC2 Spot instances – we’ve been doing it for years for 100% our worker nodes. Now, with Karpenter, others seem to be doing it more and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we keep going to KubeCon – and other conferences? Well, three goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;discovering new approaches and tools that might help us better serve our customers in the future;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confirming the solutions we are working with are used by many others in the community, which &lt;em&gt;(probably)&lt;/em&gt; means they are &lt;em&gt;(still)&lt;/em&gt; the right tools;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and learning how to do some things better every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s funny how each of us noticed different matters, depending on which parts of our platform we work on and depending on our experience and knowledge in Cloud Native solutions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to suggest a few things to KubeCon’s organizers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30 minutes talks is sometimes a bit short and longer talks could go deeper into technical details;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rooms were not big enough for popular talks – and we’re talking about “tech” talks ;-)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;food 😵. I mean, we’re French 😅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Le jeu de la vie est un drôle de jeu qui a la particularité de n’avoir pas de joueur. Il se joue de lui-même et produit des configurations qui semblent évoluer de manière autonome, sans intervention extérieure. A partir de règles très basiques, des structures d’une très grande complexité peuvent émerger d’une manière qui évoque l’apparition de la vie sur Terre à partir d’éléments inertes, d’où le nom mystérieux de jeu de la vie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Comme ce jeu se joue idéalement sur des plateaux sans limite de taille, la question des performances de l’implémentation est capitale. Pour du développement web, cet exemple permet à la fois de voir les limites de JavaScript pour effectuer un grand nombre de calculs et de présenter une solution complémentaire à la réduction de la complexité algorithmique : une implémentation en WebAssembly qui permet de déléguer la charge de calcul à un langage compilé plus performant, Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Pourquoi l’intelligence artificielle doit-elle s’entraîner pour devenir meilleure, et comment fait-elle ? C’est quoi un réseau de neurones ? Comment Dall-E arrive-t-il à dessiner de si belles images ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Depuis peu, l’intelligence artificielle fait énormément parler d’elle. Pourtant, derrière les termes de “Deep learning” et de “Réseau de neurones”, il est rare de comprendre exactement ce qui se passe dans la machine. Et si on explorait ça ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Découvrons ensemble, dans une présentation ne demandant strictement aucune compétence technique, les bases de l’apprentissage de ces intelligences, afin de comprendre un peu plus ce qui se passe derrière les rouages et toute cette magie !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;N’hésitez surtout pas à venir même sans la moindre connaissance technique, le but de cette conférence est que même votre grand-mère puisse y venir, et en ressortir en étant capable d’expliquer ce qu’est une IA !&lt;/p&gt;

Étant tout nouveau dans le dev et encore plus nouveau sur le projet, ma vie ces derniers temps est une suite d’obstacles, d’essais, d’erreurs et de triomphes (pas toujours, mais souvent) bien mérités. Je suis habitué à faire des erreurs plus lunaires les unes que les autres, mais je vais m’attarder dans cet article sur une erreur qui m’a retourné le cerveau. Au menu : erreurs soudaines, dépendances disparues et désespoir… Bonne lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je suis alternant depuis un an à Bedrock et je travaille pour la première fois sur notre projet web interne. C’est un projet qui est très complexe, avec lequel vient énormément d’historique (premières briques écrite en 2014) et dont la lecture du code relève parfois autant de l’histoire que du développement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;en-route-pour-laventure&quot;&gt;En route pour l’aventure&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;D’ailleurs à Bedrock, si on arrive à maintenir notre application web dans la durée, c’est grâce aux &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.bedrockstreaming.com/2021/09/06/web-best-practices.html&quot;&gt;bonnes pratiques qu’on essaie de respecter au mieux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En bref, je n’ai qu’une connaissance très superficielle du projet et des outils qu’il intègre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dans mes habitudes de code, il peut parfois m’arriver d’oublier de vérifier que le code que j’écris ne vienne pas casser les tests en place dans le code. Heureusement, notre CI qui nous est chère ne manque jamais de me rappeler mon manque de rigueur. Cette fois-là, je casse un test à cause d’une erreur tellement anodine que je ne parviens pas à m’en rappeler. Je peux juste vous dire que j’ai eu le réflexe d’aller dans mon terminal de lancer le runner de test jest à l’aide de notre package manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://pnpm.io/fr/&quot;&gt;pnpm&lt;/a&gt; dans une commande qui ressemble à : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pnpm test TEST_QUI_CASSE&lt;/code&gt;. Le test est rouge pour une raison qui me semble venir d’un problème de dépendances. Ayant beaucoup trituré mes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, je me dis que repartir sur des bases propres ne devrait pas faire de mal au projet. Je décide donc, sans savoir ce qui m’attend, de lancer l’innocente commande : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pnpm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J’observe que pnpm fait son travail, met à jour des dépendances, je devais effectivement avoir joué un peu trop avec mes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je relance le test et là quelle ne fut pas ma surprise quand mon terminal, sans trembler, m’a affiché &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command: &quot;jest&quot; not found&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je commence à penser que je ne viens pas seulement de casser un test, mais j’ai également cassé &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/fr/&quot;&gt;jest&lt;/a&gt;. À ce moment-là, je venais de ressortir d’une bataille avec des dépendances et donc je venais de me familiariser avec le &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pnpm&lt;/code&gt; et autre &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt; . C’est dans ce dernier dossier que je me rends compte qu’effectivement, il y manque l’exécutable jest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En fait, il y manque également d’autres outils que je m’attendais à trouver comme &lt;a href=&quot;https://prettier.io/&quot;&gt;prettier&lt;/a&gt; et &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je me dis que la portée de mon problème vient de s’étendre de jest à mes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. 🫠&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Désespéré, je tente une recherche globale des mots clés : &lt;strong&gt;prettier&lt;/strong&gt; et &lt;strong&gt;eslint&lt;/strong&gt;. Je finis par trouver une correspondance intéressante dans le fichier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.npmrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voilà à quoi ressemble le fichier à ce moment-là :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;public-hoist-pattern[]=*@testing-library/jest-dom*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@testing-library/react*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@testing-library/user-event*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*enzyme*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*jest*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*redux-mock-store*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*eslint*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*prettier*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je peux sentir qu’il s’agit d’une véritable piste parce que dans ce fichier sont listées toutes les dépendances qui sont cassées sur ma machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comprendre-la-configuration-de-pnpm&quot;&gt;Comprendre la configuration de pnpm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hoisting-des-dépendances&quot;&gt;Hoisting des dépendances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour comprendre la configuration &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt; il faut d’abord comprendre comment sont formés les &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; par pnpm. Il ne va mettre dans le dossier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; en racine uniquement les dépendances directes du projet, toutes les sous-dépendances seront placées dans un dossier caché &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pnpm&lt;/code&gt; et un lien symbolique sera créé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Je vous invite à lire la &lt;a href=&quot;https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure&quot;&gt;documentation écrite par pnpm&lt;/a&gt; afin de comprendre leur système de dépendances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cela peut parfois poser des problèmes avec des libraries qui utilisent des dépendances fantômes. C’est pourquoi pnpm laisse quand même du contrôle sur ce comportement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On parle de dépendance fantôme pour désigner toutes les dépendances qui ne sont pas désignées dans le &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; root mais qui sont quand même nécessaire pour le bon fonctionnement de l’application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt; permet d’indiquer les dépendances qu’on veut forcer à être dans le dossier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; racine plutôt que dans&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules/.pnpm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La ligne &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern[]=*jest*&lt;/code&gt; veut donc dire qu’on ajoute jest aux dépendances qui sont accessibles depuis la racine et ainsi l’exécutable dans &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules/.bin&lt;/code&gt; . Cela permet par exemple de déléguer la configuration et l’import de jest dans un package enfant du repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retour-à-lhistoire-lets-debug&quot;&gt;Retour à l’histoire… let’s debug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cet instant je suis convaincu que c’est le fichier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.npmrc&lt;/code&gt; qui est responsable de l’erreur &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command: &quot;jest&quot; not found&lt;/code&gt;. Je ne vois rien d’anormal dans ce fichier qui pourrait me mettre la puce à l’oreille, c’est alors que je me dis que peut être pnpm ne lit pas la bonne configuration. En lisant la documentation, je tombe sur la commande parfaite : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pnpm config get&lt;/code&gt;. Cette commande permet d’afficher la configuration que résout pnpm. La sortie de cette commande m’a mis sur une nouvelle piste puisque c’est là que j’ai vu apparaître la ligne problématique : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist=false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je tente de chercher dans le projet où est écrite cette ligne. Aucune trace de cette maudite ligne. Je retourne tout le projet à la recherche d’une ligne de code qui pourrait ajouter cette ligne de configuration. Je me mets à lire toute la documentation pnpm pour pouvoir comprendre d’où cette ligne peut venir. Après avoir désinstallé et réinstallé pnpm, node et redémarré mon PC, je tente dans un dernier espoir de créer un dossier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test-a-laide&lt;/code&gt; dans lequel je reclone le projet. Malheureusement, rien n’y fait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C’est à ce moment que je me dis que si le problème ne vient pas de mes outils ni de la configuration locale, il faut peut-être que j’aille chercher dans ma configuration globale. En effet, en ouvrant cette dite configuration &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.npmrc&lt;/code&gt;, je m’aperçois que c’est de là que vient la ligne &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist=false&lt;/code&gt;. C’est un soulagement, j’ai enfin trouvé d’où cette ligne mystique venait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Je suis encore à la recherche de la réponse à la question : pourquoi diable, ai-je mis cette configuration dans mon &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.npmrc&lt;/code&gt; global. Je pense me souvenir l’avoir fait en me disant que je voulais m’assurer que pnpm se comporte en faisant des symlinks (l’intention n’était pas mauvaise, mais la conséquence pas joyeuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On peut lire dans la documentation de pnpm que : &lt;em&gt;Setting shamefully-hoist to true is the same as setting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt; to *.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En d’autres termes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist&lt;/code&gt; à une influence sur le hoisting de toutes les dépendances du projet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J’ai deux problèmes avec la documentation à ce sujet :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tout d’abord, il n’est pas explicité le cas inverse à savoir si on met &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist=false&lt;/code&gt; alors ça revient à écraser toutes les configurations de &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Le comportement, qu’il soit un bug ou un cas à la marge, de la configuration globale de &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist&lt;/code&gt; qui écrase la configuration locale de &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt; n’est pas spécifié&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bref, après avoir déduit que c’était cette ligne qui cassait mon hoisting, je retire la ligne et je lance un pnpm install. Bingo ! Je récupère toutes mes dépendances perdues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enseignements&quot;&gt;Enseignements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J’essaie a posteriori de déchiffrer pourquoi j’ai eu ce problème et comment faire en sorte que cela n’arrive pas. Je pense être tombé sur un comportement étrange de pnpm. Je ne sais pas s’il s’agit d’un bug ou d’une feature. En effet, intuitivement, j’aurais tendance à dire qu’une configuration globale de &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shamefully-hoist&lt;/code&gt; ne devrait pas override la configuration locale de &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-hoist-pattern&lt;/code&gt;. Je suis prêt à entendre que le comportement est attendu et voulu, mais dans ce cas je pense qu’un peu plus de documentation à ce sujet ne peinera personne. À cet égard j’ai ouvert &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/7312&quot;&gt;une issue&lt;/a&gt; sur le Github de pnpm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je retire plusieurs enseignements de cette aventure :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Douter de la configuration qui est lue par les outils&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La documentation ne contient pas toujours tous les comportements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Il faut penser à voir plus loin que son fichier local de config et penser aux potentielles surcharges…&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Alexander Broadbent (Principal Engineer - SAPI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cette conférence expliquait, en détail, une technique “design-first” permettant d’éradiquer les erreurs de “désynchronisation” entre la documentation d’une API et son comportement réel, tout en générant une partie du code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/what-we-are-doing.png&quot; alt=&quot;What we are doing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/how-we-are-winning.png&quot; alt=&quot;How we are winning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cette technique peut se résumer en quelques points :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;la documentation OpenAPI est la source de vérité et décrit l’intégralité des endpoints de l’application (celle-ci peut être fragmentée en plusieurs fichiers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;un outil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Redocly/redoc&quot;&gt;redocly&lt;/a&gt;) regroupe tous les documents OpenAPI dans un même fichier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;un outil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript&quot;&gt;openapi-typescript&lt;/a&gt;) génère le typage Typescript correspondant au fichier OpenAPI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;un outil (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seriousme/fastify-openapi-glue&quot;&gt;fastify-openapi-glue&lt;/a&gt;) applique le typage Typescript généré sur le code des différents endpoints de l’API &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastify.dev/&quot;&gt;Fastify&lt;/a&gt; afin de s’assurer que le code produit par les développeurs est conforme à la documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Zacaria Chtatar (Backend Software Engineer - HaveSomeCode)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cette conférence au titre subversif expliquait pourquoi Zacaria, développeur Typescript/NodeJS à ClubMed, en est arrivé à s’intéresser très fortement au langage de programmation Rust… Au point d’en faire la promotion, en anglais (respect), aux API Days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La première partie de sa conférence parlait du langage de programmation Typescript, en dressant une liste de ses qualités (fullstack, très largement déployé en entreprise, écosystème riche, …) et de ses défauts (gestion d’erreur optionnelle, typage éphémère, runtime principal peu performant, …). Cette première partie s’est achevée par un message clair : “Typescript is not enough”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/typescript-is-not-enough.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typescript is not enough&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La suite et fin de la présentation, quant à elle, était une introduction à Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/introducing-rust.png&quot; alt=&quot;Introducing Rust&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bien que nous étions surpris de voir que &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages&quot;&gt;le langage de programmation préféré des développeurs&lt;/a&gt; de ces 8 dernières années, et sur lequel &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.rust-lang.org/members/&quot;&gt;les plus grosses entreprises tech du monde misent aujourd’hui&lt;/a&gt;, avait encore besoin d’être mis en avant en 2023… Zacaria a effectivement eu raison d’en remettre une couche, car encore trop peu d’entreprises françaises ont pris conscience des avantages qu’offre Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cependant, cette 2ème partie de conférence avait un goût de déjà vu pour nous car un de nos collaborateurs a déjà donné le même genre de conférence à Bedrock durant &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.bedrockstreaming.com/lft/&quot;&gt;nos LFT&lt;/a&gt; 2 années auparavant (en partant de PHP plutôt que de Typescript)… Ceci étant, grâce à nos 2 ans d’expérience de Rust en production et pour les raisons évoquées par Zacaria durant son talk, Bedrock est en mesure de témoigner sa satisfaction d’avoir pris le temps de réécrire certaines des API les plus critiques de Bedrock en Rust. Et nous espérons que de nombreuses entreprises oseront suivre notre exemple, afin de permettre aux développeurs soucieux de la qualité de leur travail comme Zacaria, de disposer de ce merveilleux langage de programmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et si vous ne comprenez toujours pas l’intérêt de Rust, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSo3e3ugn5g&quot;&gt;le talk de Zacaria est disponible en replay sur Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-life-rest-api-versioning-strategies-and-best-practices&quot;&gt;Real-Life REST API Versioning: Strategies and Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Alexandre Touret (Senior Software Architect - Worldline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La gestion des versions dans le contexte des API au sein d’une entreprise peut souvent s’avérer être un défi complexe et délicat. En effet, les interfaces de programmation applicative (API) constituent le cœur des interactions entre différents services et applications au sein d’un écosystème numérique. La nécessité de versionner ces API devient impérative pour garantir une évolution harmonieuse tout en préservant la compatibilité avec les systèmes existants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worldline fait partie des entreprises avec une architecture technique complexe, exposant à des clients finaux un modèle métier en constante évolution.
Ce problème fait très fortement écho avec le business model de Bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dans sa conférence, Alexandre a présenté son retour d’expérience sur comment versionner une API. Et comment l’exercice est loin d’être un long fleuve tranquille. Voici les points clés que nous avons retenus :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toutes-les-apis-ne-nécessitent-pas-dêtre-versionnées&quot;&gt;Toutes les APIs ne nécessitent pas d’être versionnées&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le versioning c’est compliqué. C’est un fait. Autant l’appliquer sur des APIs où ce principe est vraiment utile. Il est effectivement peut-être moins utile de versionner une API interne, non exposée sur internet ou avec un périmètre fonctionnel très limité ou stable.
Voici les questions proposées par Alexandre qui peuvent nous aider dans notre décision : ai-je besoin de versionner ? Combien de versions dois-je gérer en parallèle ? Est-ce que ma plateforme est compatible ? Quels sont les impacts sur ma configuration, mon modèle de données, &lt;strong&gt;mon système d’authentification&lt;/strong&gt; (Alexandre a bien insisté sur ce point. Il ne faut pas négliger l’authentification dans la problématique du versioning) ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;le-versioning-sapplique-aussi-sur-une-architecture-en-micro-service&quot;&gt;Le versioning s’applique aussi sur une architecture en micro service&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a tendance à croire que seules “les grosses API” sont concernées par le versioning mais Alexandre nous a montré qu’il n’en est rien. Un micro service, aussi micro (voir macro) qu’il soit, gère à lui tout seul un périmètre fonctionnel. Il est donc légitime qu’il puisse évoluer au fil des versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comment-gérer-le-versioning&quot;&gt;Comment gérer le versioning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plusieurs solutions, directement dans l’URL, via header (plus facile avec une API existante)
Alexandre a fortement déconseillé d’utiliser le versioning par content type. À la fois peu lisible et difficilement maintenable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/api-versioning.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comment gérer le versionning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limpact-du-versioning&quot;&gt;L’impact du versioning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Versionner une API change en profondeur nos manières de travailler. Et ce à plusieurs niveaux :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Le code source, la technique. Il est indéniable que le code source ainsi que l’architecture technique de vos projets s’en verra impactés. L’impact ne s’arrête pas au code en lui-même, mais sur tout ce qui gravite autour. Nos bases de données, nos scripts, nos configurations serveur ou nos images docker par exemple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Le produit. Nos API exposent le métier de notre produit. L’impact n’est donc pas que technique, mais aussi fonctionnel / produit. Une évolution de version technique entraine des breaking change et inversement. Il est donc très important, les équipes et produit travaillent de pair pour évoluer ensemble&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La livraison. Avoir plusieurs versions d’un API complexifie la mise en production de cette dernière. Il faudra très certainement revoir nos pipelines d’intégration et de déploiement. Ce point est, lui aussi, à ne pas négliger et nécessitera un travail commun au sein des équipes techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lobservabilité&quot;&gt;L’observabilité&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandre nous a aussi parlé de l’importance d’avoir de la visibilité sur ce qu’il se passe en production, et tout particulièrement à la maille des différentes versions de nos API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’observabilité est quelque chose de plus en plus répandu dans notre métier. Mais le versioning porte le concept encore un cran au-dessus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il est primordial d’être capable d’assurer une bonne observabilité de nos APIs à la maille :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;De la version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Des clients (via des API Keys dédiées)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Une bonne observabilité est la clé pour définir une bonne stratégie et être capable d’anticiper le dé commissionnement de versions obsolètes. Ce point est selon moi très important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il est très (très) compliqué de maintenir un nombre trop élevé de versions pour une même API. Sans parler d’obsolescence programmée, il faut trouver le bon niveau de maintenance pour éviter de tomber dans le piège de la dette technique. Pas facile comme sujet !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour finir, je tiens à remercier Alexandre pour sa conférence vraiment intéressante. Bourrée d’exemples concrets. J’ai vraiment senti une vraie maîtrise du sujet. Bravo ! Cette conférence est mon coup de cœur de l’API Days Paris 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-ongoing-journey-from-rest-to-graphql-on-android&quot;&gt;Our Ongoing Journey From REST To GraphQL On Android&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Julien Salvi (Lead Android Engineer - Aircall)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durant cette présentation, Julien Salvi, Lead Android Engineer chez Aircall nous fait un retour d’expérience sur la migration de l’équipe Android d’une API REST à une API GraphQL. Ce choix a été motivé par plusieurs raisons :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Une problématique globale sur le scaling de leur API REST&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L’efficacité et l’agrégation des données des API GraphQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La recherche d’une alternative Serverless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L’objectif de limiter les perturbations pour les clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leur aventure débute mi 2020 et est toujours en cours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/graphql-api-journey.png&quot; alt=&quot;GraphQL API journey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour répondre à ces demandes, les équipes ont dirigé leur choix vers GraphQL pour créer leur nouvelles API, qui a plusieurs avantages selon Julien notamment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;La possibilité pour les clients de récupérer seulement les données dont ils ont besoin, cela évite l’over-fetching et l’under-fetching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Les clients peuvent récupérer de multiples ressources dans une seule requête&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GraphQL propose un moyen d’établir une connection constante entre le client et le serveur, ce qui augmente la scalabilité en temps réel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Le fort typage de GraphQL permet une communication claire, réduisant ainsi les erreurs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L’amélioration de la performance globale grâce au batching des requêtes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L’équipe Android utilise le service &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/fr/appsync/&quot;&gt;AppSync d’AWS&lt;/a&gt;, facilitant le filtrage, permetttant de faire du realtime, assurer une scalabilité et une bonne intégration avec ElasticSearch et DynamoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Après les premières migrations vers les API GraphQL, le conférencier insiste sur l’importance du monitoring, qui chez eux est présent que ce soit pour les queries ou les mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voici les points à retenir de leur expérience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/key-takeaways.png&quot; alt=&quot;Key takeaways&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour finir, revenons sur un de leur point à surveiller, Julien nous évoque l’importance de la collaboration entre les équipes front et backend qui est également selon nous très importante, notamment pour optimiser l’efficacité des API. On peut citer comme actions par exemple, se mettre d’accord sur les meilleurs timeout à adopter sur les API ou aussi créer les schémas OpenApi ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-api-contracts-matters&quot;&gt;Why API Contracts matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Stéve Sfartz (Principal Architect - Cisco)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cette présentation par le Principal Architect de Cisco nous explique pourquoi, dans une stratégie API First, le besoin d’avoir des contrats ainsi qu’un cycle de vie de l’API est primordial pour la cohérence du système.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ils formalisent leur contrats d’API via OpenAPI Spécification, un standard pour les contrats d’API REST, en complément de documents OpenAPI, pour former la définition de l’API. A côté de cette définition, on trouve la gestion du cycle de vie (lifecycle) de l’API, pour informer des deprecated, du changelog et des Breaking Changes lors des versions majeures (semantic versionning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/api-contract-definition-and-lifecycle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Definition and Lifecycle for an API&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lors de la mise en place de ces contrats pour les API à cisco, une qualité (qu’ils appellent aussi Health Contract) y a été associée pour avoir une vue d’ensemble de la documentation des API. Ayant environ 2000 API, cette qualité ne peut pas être évaluée à la main au cas par cas, et passe donc par des outils d’analyse tels qu’un linter Spectral, pour éviter les erreurs et automatiser la génération de ce statut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/api-contract-quality.png&quot; alt=&quot;API Contract Quality&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vient ensuite la gestion du drift entre la documentation et le code (par exemple si une annotation est oubliée, une route non documentée) : la vérification du drift doit être faite lors de la CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La conférence se conclut sur une question simple : “Quelle est la source de vérité pour vos API ?”. La réponse est bien évidemment le code, mais une documentation générée automatiquement permet justement de s’en rapprocher grandement. A Bedrock, nos API GraphQL ont leur documentation (schéma) généré automatiquement à partir du code lors du merge d’une PR, ce qui permet d’éviter les oublis de mise à jour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-bring-science-into-api-docs&quot;&gt;Let’s bring science into API docs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conférence présentée par Lana Novikova (Technical Writer - JetBrains)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Au cours de cette conférence, Lana Novikova explore comment fusionner les principes scientifiques avec une communication technique efficace dans la documentation des API. 
Elle partage également ses connaissances sur la façon dont les développeurs et développeuses consomment l’information en ligne, en mettant en lumière les liens avec différents styles cognitifs, le tout appuyé par des articles scientifiques. Elle explique de manière concrète comment ces principes peuvent être appliqués dans la documentation des API et comment ils peuvent contribuer à améliorer l’expérience des développeurs et développeuses.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SdGWU867bs&quot;&gt;Sa conférence est une extension d’un précédent talk qu’elle a donné en 2022 à la “Write The Docs Australia”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La première étude que nous présente Lana s’intitule &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/papers/tse2013a.pdf&quot;&gt;“Patterns of Knowledge in API Reference Documentation”&lt;/a&gt;. 
Elle parle de la nature et de l’organisation des connaissances contenues dans la documentation de référence de centaines d’API au sein de deux plateformes technologiques : Java SDK 6 et .NET 4.0. L’étude a, entre autres, consisté à élaborer une taxonomie des types de connaissances et a pu dresser la liste de 12 types de connaissances distinctes dans la documentation de l’API :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/taxonomy-of-knowledge-types.png&quot; alt=&quot;Taxonomy of Knowledge Types&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;À travers cette étude, nous pouvons donc évaluer le contenu de la documentation de notre API en fonction des types de connaissances et ainsi développer des modèles de documentation adaptés aux connaissances communément associées aux différents types de composants de l’api. De plus, aujourd’hui, des projets comme &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegooddocsproject.dev/&quot;&gt;the good docs project&lt;/a&gt; existent et proposent des templates de documentation basés sur ces données scientifiques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La deuxième étude exposée dans cette conférence a comme titre &lt;a href=&quot;http://sigdoc.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CDQ18002_Meng_Steinhardt_Schubert.pdf&quot;&gt;“How Developers Use API Documentation: An Observation Study”&lt;/a&gt;. Sa méthodologie consiste à l’observation active, via des screencasts et des protocoles verbaux, des activités des personnes participantes pendant le test. Les chercheurs et chercheuses ont évalué le taux de réussite, le temps passé sur les tâches et l’utilisation de la documentation et des catégories de contenu. L’objectif principal est d’observer comment les développeurs et développeuses abordent les tâches avec une API qu’elles ne connaissent pas. Il s’agit également d’analyser comment les développeurs et développeuses utilisent les ressources d’information proposées par la documentation de l’API. Cela permet de caractériser les stratégies adoptées par les développeurs et développeuses lorsqu’elles commencent à travailler avec une nouvelle API. La conclusion que Lana nous partage est qu’en moyenne, les personnes participantes ont utilisé la documentation de l’API environ 49 % du temps (Min : 31 %, Max : 68 %). La catégorie de contenu à laquelle il est fait référence le plus souvent est “API reference”, suivie de “Recipes page”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/content-categories-of-the-api-documentation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Content categories of the API documentation used for the test&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/api-days-paris-2023/proportion-of-time-spent-on-individual-content-categories.png&quot; alt=&quot;Proportion of time spent on individual content categories&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il se dégage que le temps que les personnes participantes consacrent aux différentes catégories de contenu varie considérablement d’une personne à l’autre. Sur la base de ces données, les chercheurs et chercheuses ont défini trois types de personnages de développeurs logiciels à la recherche d’informations ainsi que leurs approches lorsqu’ils opèrent celles-ci: Systematic learners, Opportunistic learners et Pragmatic learners. Pour les personnes curieuses d’approfondir le sujet, ces personae sont basés sur une autre étude intitulée &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30815675_What_is_an_End_User_Software_Engineer&quot;&gt;“What is an end user software engineer?”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lana Novikova conclut en mettant l’accent sur le fait qu’il faut respecter les différentes stratégies adoptées par les développeurs et les développeuses lorsqu’elles abordent une nouvelle API et nous propose d’appliquer ces conseils :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour les “opportunistic learners”, donner des exemples de code complets et exhaustifs en donnant la possibilité de masquer tout le reste et de relier le texte au code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour les “systematic learners”, fournir des informations importantes de manière redondante et donner des connaissances de base pertinentes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour les “pragmatic learners” (et les autres), donner un moyen technique pour commencer à utiliser une API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je tiens personnellement à souligner qu’il est rare d’assister à une conférence aussi complète se basant sur autant de données scientifiques. Je ressors de cette conférence agréablement surpris de la qualité de tout ce qui a été proposé et des ressources mises à disposition. Je vous laisse avec &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/lananovikova10/lets-bring-science-into-api-docs-c9bd5a57-df28-4fa3-9388-d2d9d9a044bd&quot;&gt;un lien contenant toutes les slides de la présentation de Lana Novikova&lt;/a&gt; qui expliquera bien mieux le propos que mon résumé. Bravo à elle et à son travail, en espérant voir de plus en plus de conférences de ce genre à l’avenir.&lt;/p&gt;
