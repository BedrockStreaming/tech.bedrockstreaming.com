A _quick_ sidetrack in [our series](#from-the-same-series) about Bedrock's API gateway.
This piece defines what are we talking about when we say "an error", and explains how we handle the numerous connections to services we are calling.

## Definition

In [the previous article](/2022/08/12/backend-fallbacks.html), we've seen how we handle errors.
This was mainly from a business point of view, and how it's done in our domain.

*But what is "an error"?*

This term is a bit generic, and the definition will be too: *an error is anything unexpected by the application*.

In our context of an API Gateway, we are restricting this to the services we are calling.

This can be, but not exhaustively, a service not responding because:
* it's offline;
* it's taking too much time to answer;
* it's responding with a 5** error (when talking about an API);
* it's giving us an invalid or unexpected content.

## What are the consequences of those errors?

The first issue is: we won't be able to display some part of the application as intended.
We've [talked about this previously](https://tech.bedrockstreaming.com/2022/08/12/backend-fallbacks.html#handling-failures) already.

The second error, more insidious, is that it can slow down our BFF terribly.

The BFF response time is, on average, equals to the slowest service the BFF is calling.
If a service that usually responds in 200ms starts slowing down to an average response time of 1s and also times out half the time, it will increase the BFF response time to 1,5s (1s average, and 50% retry).

That's why we must be careful when configuring those timeouts.
The BFF exposes a response-time Service Level Objective (SLO), and frontend applications will cut any connection that takes too long.
Losing some parts of the responses is better than slowing the BFF down to a point where frontend won't get any response at all.

## How are we mitigating the errors?

For any remote service, we configure short timeouts, and retry when we must.
A short timeout is a timeout that usually match the SLO of the called services, and that will match 99% of our calls.
When the SLO of the called service is higher than ours, we use a shorter timeout and accept that a larger parts of the calls will be cut.
The values are tailored according to our usages.
We use our monitoring to adapt those values in order to reduce the number of errors, while minimizing the impact on the BFF response time.
We are also constantly challenging our colleagues to improve the average response time of their services that we are calling.

The choice of using retries is based on the information criticality.
For example, retrieving the user's previous viewing sessions, is important for his/her experience, so we're using a retry here.
On the opposite, analytics are less important, so we don't use any retry there.

```yaml
    app.http_client_configs.best_effort:
        retry: 1
        timeout: 0.6
        connect_timeout: 0.1
    app.http_client_configs.fast_fail:
        retry: 0
        timeout: 0.6
        connect_timeout: 0.1
    app.http_client_configs.long_fail:
        retry: 0
        timeout: 1
        connect_timeout: 0.1
    app.http_client_configs.reliant:
        retry: 2
        timeout: 60
        connect_timeout: 0.1
```
Above, you can see the yaml configuration our Symfony application uses to build its Guzzle clients.

Each configuration can cascade onto the clients, making variants available for our Symfony services.

Below lies a Symfony configuration example:
* We have an interface `BFF\Domain\Content\Repository` from the domain for a content repository.
* The interface is linked to an implementation `BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient` inside the infrastructure.
* The implementation is built with variants (`best_effort` and `fast_fail`) from a factory using the matching Guzzle configurations.
* Other services use a chosen repository *according to their needs and criticality*.

```yaml
    # Service definition with its aliases.
    BFF\Domain\Content\Repository: '@BFF\Domain\Content\Repository.fast_fail'
    BFF\Domain\Content\Repository.best_effort: '@BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient.best_effort'
    BFF\Domain\Content\Repository.fast_fail: '@BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient.fast_fail'

    # Concrete implementations
    BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient.best_effort:
        class: 'BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient'
        factory: ['@BFF\Infra\ContentClientFactory', 'create']
        bind:
            $clientConfig: '%app.http_client_configs.best_effort%'
    BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient.fast_fail:
        class: 'BFF\Infra\HttpContentClient'
        factory: ['@BFF\Infra\ContentClientFactory', 'create']
        bind:
            $clientConfig: '%app.http_client_configs.fast_fail%'

    # Other services using the Repository
    BFF\Domain\Navigation\NavBarResolver:
        $content: '@BFF\Domain\Content\Repository.best_effort'

    BFF\Domain\Layout\BlockResolver:
        $content: '@BFF\Domain\Content\Repository.fast_fail'
```

_This is an over simplified example as we have more layers and wrappers used for things like caching, monitoring, logging, etc._

## Conclusion

In this article, we've clarified what an error is, and explained that we cannot generalize the configuration and usage of our APIs. Timeouts and retries, especially, must be tailored depending on the criticality of each call.

This was a deviation on the road to our next article, where we will talk about monitoring the errors and stopping calls to failing APIs by implementing the circuit-breaker pattern.
